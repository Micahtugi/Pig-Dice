    <p>Hello and welcome to the pig-dice game! The aim of the game is to reach 100 points before your competitor does. This game is played by a six-sided die. After rolling the die, the player can choose to hold and give a chance for the opponent player to play. Once a player reaches 100 points, they are alerted that they have won the game! Have fun while playing!!!!
